# Lettuce_help

Lettuce Help is an app that primarily addresses inefficiencies in the donation and collection process of FoodBank boxes.  When it comes to food donations,  Donors occasionally encounter overfilled boxes due to the manual nature of inspecting these boxes - i.e, when a FoodBank box is reaching full capacity, a volunteer must physically inspect the box and notify a FoodBank staff that the box is ready for collection. If this process is not carried out, food donations will accumulate in the box and donors, who wish to donate to that same box, will either leave the donated food crowding around the box (pest hazard) or find another Foodbank box to donate to (additional effort and time wasted).  Both of these scenarios are not ideal. 

Lettuce-help addresses these issues by delivering box capacity data at the fingertips of the user. Box capacity data is obtained via our smart food box that is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor -to detect box capacity- and a wifi-module- to allow for real time updates. For staff accounts, box data is displayed in a recycler view format, sorted from most filled to least filled. Staff will also have the option to accept or decline, picking up filled boxes from their notification. For volunteer accounts, box capacity data is incorporated into google maps, where the app shows all nearby boxes, relative to the user’s current position, and its corresponding capacities.  These solutions allow staff to prioritize the collection of fully filled boxes and volunteers to avoid filled boxes. 

The app also contains information pertaining to ‘ FoodBank Sg’ , along with user registration, forget password, reset password, saved login and issue reporting functionalities.
